    Nigel is reposting ssh error are continuing.

    My previous notes I was checking for the Zeppelin service on port 80, but I should have been checking on port 8080.

    # Much shorter conversation ... not sure why.
    # It didn't offer any keys from ssh-agent, again, not user why.
    #

    #
    # Most recent notes on deploying the live service are here:
    # notes/stv/20201130-ansible-deploy-hadoop-zeppelin-02.txt
    #

    #
    # Some unknown usernames and passwords.
    # - Zeppelin user accounts
    # - github username and password
    #

    #
    # In the notes, Stelios logs in to the zeppelin VM via ssh and edits the config files manually.
    # The notes don't have the usernames and passwords, and they aren't anywhare I can access them.
    # Plus I don't have ssh access to the zeppelin node anyway.
    #

    #
    # Before I try rebooting VMs containing services I can't administer,
    # setup another server with Nigel's ssh key and test his ssh access to that.
