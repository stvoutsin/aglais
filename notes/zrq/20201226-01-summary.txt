    Where we are ...

    Zeppelin fails with FileNotFound issue with reading Parquet files into Spark.
    Possibly linked to the transition from Ubuntu to Debian and Java-8 to Java-11 ?

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Zeppelin fails with NoClassDefFoundError for JDBC and XML classes.
    Looks like some of the standard J2EE libraries are missing.
    Seem to remember this on another project ?
