    Building the base image for Zeppelin.

    The Dockerfile contains the follwing steps:

    >   ....
    >   RUN echo "$LOG_TAG Install R related packages" && \
    >       ....
    >       apt-get -y install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libssl-dev libgit2-dev && \
    >       R -e "install.packages('devtools', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')" && \
    >       ....

    When building this using buildah inside an instance of the 'firethorn/builder:latest' container,
    we get the following errors:

    >   ....
    >   ....
    >   * installing *source* package ‘credentials’ ...

    We have already had to make this change to our Dockerfile

    git diff  experiments/kubernetes/docker/zeppelin/base/Dockerfile

    >   -    wget --quiet https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-4.6.14-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh && \
    >   -    /bin/bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/conda && \
    >   -    rm ~/miniconda.sh
    >   +    wget --quiet https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-4.6.14-Linux-x86_64.sh -O /tmp/miniconda.sh && \
    >   +    /bin/bash /tmp/miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/conda && \
    >   +    rm /tmp/miniconda.sh


    Building the same Dockerfile works when running buildah outside the container.

    I think this is linked to the way that we needed to run buildah inside the container.

    buildah bud \
        --format docker \
        --isolation chroot \
        --storage-driver vfs \
        --root '/var/local/cache/buildah' \
        --runroot '/var/local/cache/buildah' \
        ....
        "${AGLAIS_CODE:?}/experiments/kubernetes/docker/zeppelin/base"

    We needed these settings in order to get buildah to run inside a container,
    but the side effect is, the installing user does not have a home directory.

    More specifically, the bash environment variables `$HOME` and `~` are not set.

    Which has implications and side effects for some of the Debian package installs.
    In this case, the R `credentials` package.

    Scratch ~1 day to figure all this out, and revert back to running buildah
    directly in the VM rather than inside a podman container.

    Merry Xmas everyone.
